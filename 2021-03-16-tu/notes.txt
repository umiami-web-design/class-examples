CAN CSS BE NESTED? (No.)
NOTE: We are not using SASS in this course. This is just for reference related to the discussion in class.

- SASS supports nesting; CSS does not.

/* SASS version: */

#geography {
  background-color: blue;

  abbr {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
}

/* How SASS translates to CSS: */
#geography {
  background-color: blue;
}

#geography abbr {
  background-color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}


CSS COLORS
- writing a color name <-- don't use this; too easy, not flexible!
- hex value
- rgb value
- rgba value (introduces alpha transparency)
- hsl value
