#README

This solution is incomplete as it only reflects what was covered in the lecture on Tuesday, Feb. 23.

If you would like more practice, consider doing the following:

- Include another navigation on the `characters.html`, `neighbors.html` and `non-playable-characters.html` pages which link to the pages in this character section. You can either create a new, secondary nav on the page OR use a nested list in the existing nav!

- Fix the link(s) in `games.html`.

- Place all `.jpg` and `.png` files in an `images` folder. Fix all existing image tags within the site to make the images appear and include a couple of the other provided images on other pages. For instance, you may add `rover.png` on `neighbors.html`; `tom-nook.png` on `non-playable-characters.html`; `ac-cover-art.png` on `games.html`.
