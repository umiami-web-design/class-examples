        <h2 class="highlight">Introduction</h2>

        <p>Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe.</p>

        <p>An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries.</p>

        <p>Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by the <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr> in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993.</p>

        <p>Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions; it joined both <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in the spring of 2004. In 2015, Lithuania joined the euro zone, and it joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>

          <p>After the country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, Lithuania faced an initial dislocation that is typical during transitions from a planned economy to a free-market economy.</p>

          <p>Macroeconomic stabilization policies, including privatization of most state-owned enterprises, and a strong commitment to a currency board arrangement led to an open and rapidly growing economy and rising consumer demand. Foreign investment and EU funding aided in the transition.</p>

          <p>Lithuania joined the <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> in May 2001, the EU in May 2004, and the euro zone in January 2015, and is now working to complete the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> accession roadmap it received in July 2015. In 2017, joined the OECD Working Group on Bribery, an important step in the OECD accession process.</p>
