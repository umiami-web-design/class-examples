## How to download code examples

You need to have GitHub Desktop installed on your computer. Make sure you are logged in to both the GitHub web site and the GitHub Desktop application.

1. On GitHub.com, click the green 'Code' button within the `class-examples` (this) repository. Next, click 'Open with GitHub Desktop'. You may receive an alert which asks you to 'Open in GitHub Desktop?' Click 'Open in GitHub Desktop' and tick the checkbox to remember your choice.

2. When prompted to save the repository in GitHub Desktop, click 'Clone'. Note which directory on your computer you are saving the files to.

## How to update code examples

Once you have cloned (downloaded a copy of) the `class-examples` repository to your computer, you will only need to click one button to download any updates!

1. Open the GitHub Desktop application.

2. In the 'Current Repository' tab, select `class-examples` (if it is not already selected).

3. Click the 'Fetch origin' tab. All updates (including examples slides and corrections to old ones) will be downloaded to your computer.

(Yes, it's that easy!)

## How to review code examples

Examples are written in HTML (and CSS). Reviewing code is helpful for become familiar with the code you will be writing.

There are two ways to view examples:

- **As they are formatted for the web.** You can open any file by dragging it to the Firefox icon on your dock. You can also open the files from within the browser by selecting "File", then "Open File" from the menu.

- **As code.** Open the file (or folder containing multiple files) by dragging it to the Atom icon on your dock. You can also open them from within Atom, by selecting "File", then "Open" from the menu.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q. Can I view the notes online? What is the URL for these notes?*

No.

I do not set up these examples as an Internet-accessible web site so you are forced to download them. It's important that you see the code, not just the end result!

I want you get familiar with viewing code using a web browser and a text editor. See how the pages look in different browsers like Chrome, Safari or Opera. Can you spot differences? Try making changes to the code.

*Q. What if I break the code?*

I encourage you to break the code! You will learn more from breaking and fixing than doing everything perfect the first time. If you break the code, you can always revert to a "clean" copy.

To get a clean version of your notes, open GitHub Desktop. In the Current Repository tab, make sure `class-examples` is selected. Next, right-click on the file you want to refresh. Select 'Discard Changes...' then click the 'Discard Changes' button. This will delete any changes you have made to the file.

You can also discard changes to the entire repository by going to the 'Branch' menu in the navigation bar, then selecting 'Discard All Changes...'
