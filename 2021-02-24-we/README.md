#README

This solution is incomplete as it only reflects what was covered in the lecture on Wednesday, Feb. 24.

If you would like more practice, consider doing the following:

- Fix the nav on each page so it mirrors what you see on `neighbors.html` -- and works!

- Fix `characters.html` to include a secondary navigation which links to `neighbors.html` and `non-playable.html` below the "Villagers" heading.
